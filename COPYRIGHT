AUTHORS.txt).

Licensed under the license reproduced in the file LICENSE at the root of this

modified, or distributed except according to those terms.


Additional copyright may be retained by contributors other than The 6502-rs
Developers or the parties enumerated in this file. Such copyright can be
determined on a case-by-case basis by examining the author of each portion of a
file in the revision-control commit records of the project, or by consulting
representative comments claiming copyright ownership for a file.

In all such cases, the absence of explicit licensing text indicates that the
contributor chose to license their work for distribution under identical terms
to those The 6502-rs Developers have chosen for the collective work, enumerated
at the top of this file. The only difference is the retention of copyright
itself, held by the contributor.
